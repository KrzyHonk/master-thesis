After the Expense Report is received, a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one.
The report is then reviewed for automatic approval. Amounts under $200 are automatically approved, whereas amounts
equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor. In case of rejection, the employee must receive a rejection notice
by email. The reimbursement goes to the employee's direct deposit bank account. If the request is not completed in 7 days,
then the employee must receive an "approval in progress" email
